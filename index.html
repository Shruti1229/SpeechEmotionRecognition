  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p> Speech emotion recognition (SER) refers to the classification/recognition of the personâ€™s emotional state 
    using the speech signal. SER has a lot of applications in real life. It can be beneficial for applications 
    where natural human-computer interaction is required.</p>

  <p> In this work we have used Convolutional neural network for classifying emotions. Generally, spectrograms are 
    given as input to the CNN. Spectrogram is a time-frequency representation of a signal. In spectrogram, Fourier 
    transform of a short-time windowed signal is taken with some  overlapping (typically around 10 ms). However, 
    spectrgrams are unable to capture time and frequency resolution simultaneously.</p>
